{"text": " Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " So", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians, celebrities, writers (such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf), and other intellectuals about the meaning, origin and impact of this nationalism", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close!", "label": "surprise"}

{"text": " Just FYI", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Not bad", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Cyprus was amazing", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights", "label": "surprise"}

{"text": " Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " And they weren't kidding", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " Oh and the food is incredible", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " I was leading loads of tours, and working on a short film I was directing", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " The people are absolutely LOVELY", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " And they all seem to really enjoy their city", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " And man, it is gorgeous", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " So many public spaces, parks museums, gardens", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " There was a fabulous sense of community there", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs'", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " So we went across the street to the park, it was about 2:00 pm", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " I thought: that's strange, what's that about?", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " They were perfect for taking a catnap", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " so we did the same", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Had a little hour sleep, got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park?", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Vive la France!", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " We really had a ball in Paris", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " 6 were petty thieves and the seventh was a boy whose father had sent him there for a few weeks as  disciplinary measure", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit", "label": "happy"}
{"text": " Upon arrival back in the states, we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert, which was my birthday present from Lance", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well", "label": "happy"}

{"text": " I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Let's clarify", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Taleban style if you will", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " This is called the nikab", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " For clarification the difference should be noted", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " The khimar is the actual headscarf", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " The nikab, or taliban style cover, is not an Islamic practice", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies)", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " It shouldn't, he added, be decided by a group of old white male politicians", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " I'm by no means an expert on veils", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization, and it dates back well into the Middle Ages", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let's study this music from one era to the next", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music, and since I recognize all seven, let's learn about each one:", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "1", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "2", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Renaissance (1450 - 1600): Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "3", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "4", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing classical)", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "5", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Female composers gained more visibility during this period, such as Clara Schumann", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "6", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything, including world wars, politics, SEX, and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Finally, music could be recorded and distributed widely, creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Needless to say, neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": "7", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Contemporary Classical: 1970 - 2050 (projected): If the 20th Century period ends in 1999, then what do we call all classical music written thereafter?", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " Arguments in favor: 29", "label": "neutral"}

{"text": " 8 of the pro arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other", "label": "surprise"}
{"text": " As such I consider him to be primarily a politician, and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician, even when I agree with them", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up", "label": "neutral"}
{"text": " There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else", "label": "neutral"}
