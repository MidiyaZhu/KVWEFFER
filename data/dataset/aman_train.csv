" Keep It Real And Live Good,",neutral
 I can honestly say my views of the world I live in changed while in high school,neutral
" Even though I had began participating more in the Catholic church while in junior high, it wasn't until I were about 15 when I began to take a more active role in the church",neutral
" I remember being so impressed, with the youth programs of the other parishes in my area, and the stong bond that everyone had withen their own groups, regardless of the social status of each person",neutral
 Which was such a contrast when compared to the small group I belonged to,neutral
 I began pushing for the group to start doing more for themselves and for everyone else that was around them,neutral
" We began to help serve lunches at the local Loaves &amp; Fishes,  volunteer work for the school at our parish, offer lodging for other traveling youth groups",neutral
" There were also other various events that I ended up doing on my own, due to the lack of interest from others in my group",neutral
 I remember doing endless fundraisers for almost everything we did,neutral
" There were national events for Catholic youth that were able to attend, religious retreats, missionary work, and myself and a very few others were selected to goto a Christian leadership program that was offered at the time",neutral
" See, the whole time that I was trying to develop my own faith, attending events with other parishes, and all the work I did with my own group",neutral
 I actually thought I was making a difference,neutral
 And sadly,sad

 Love u all!!,happy
 Here I am again!,neutral
 Broadcasting this time from the New World,neutral
" It's been a solid half year since I sent word out, and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email",neutral
" So, to the task!",neutral
 Well,neutral
 where did we leave off?,neutral
" I believe it was April, and spring had just arrived",neutral
 I'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is,neutral
" He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel, hadn't even checked in yet, and just happened to be in the lobby when I was",neutral
 So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour,neutral
" We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well",happy
" But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe",surprise
" The rest of April passed rather uneventfully, and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater",neutral
 And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen,happy
" It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers",surprise
 My next big adventure was a trip I took to London at the end of May,neutral
" I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life",happy
 The show was trash,disgust
" Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script",disgust
 And interminably long!,disgust
 Three hours of horror,disgust
" I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed",happy
 I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work,disgust
" It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand",neutral
 While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater,neutral
 Now this was amazing,surprise
" The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire",surprise
" That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more",happy
" I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun",happy
 Loved London,happy
 Loved the free museums,happy
 Especially the British Museum,neutral
 Great East London accents,neutral
" Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message",neutral
" Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism",neutral
" And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand",happy
 Curious,surprise
" next time you're in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies!",neutral
 After London came the World Cup,neutral
 Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish,neutral
 That changed very quickly,neutral
" The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans",surprise
" Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs",happy
 Loads of fun,happy
" I didn't have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match",neutral
" And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation",neutral
 Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup,surprise
" Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter",neutral
 You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War,neutral
" And for what it's worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too",fear
 So,neutral
" People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments",happy
 Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone,happy
" In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians, celebrities, writers (such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf), and other intellectuals about the meaning, origin and impact of this nationalism",neutral
 But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing,neutral
" In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month",neutral
" This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'",neutral
" Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling that information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical context",neutral
 I ended up doing tours out there for the duration of the summer,neutral
" After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus",happy
" The occasion was that a good friend of mine from North Texas, Jessica, was playing the title role in Medea at a theater festival there",neutral
 Now this was ridiculous amounts of fun!,happy
" The city is a sweaty, dirty, polluted hole",disgust
" Now take into account that said air conditioners are mounted on the windows, sticking out over the street",neutral
 Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns,neutral
 But it was close,neutral
" And the city itself really is lovely, in it's own way",happy
" We took a day trip out to Sunion, the very tip of Greece, to see the temple of Poseidon",neutral
" And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean",surprise
" The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close!",surprise
" And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset, as the red orb of  the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill",neutral
 Just FYI,neutral
 Not bad,neutral
 Cyprus was amazing,surprise
" We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival",surprise
" We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights",surprise
 We spent pretty much the whole day (outside of a decadent lunch at the beach house) in the water,neutral
 Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special,neutral
 And they weren't kidding,neutral
" The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon",neutral
" What's more, we had the whole place to ourselves",neutral
 Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse,neutral
" It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about",happy
 Oh and the food is incredible,surprise
" They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese",neutral
" Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English",neutral
" Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones",happy
 After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly,neutral
" I was leading loads of tours, and working on a short film I was directing",neutral
" The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week",neutral
" So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years",happy
 Zurich is expensive,neutral
 But we didn't let that discourage us,neutral
" The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water",surprise
" After our detox detour en Suisse, we headed via night train to Paris",neutral
 It's called the city of love and light for a reason,neutral
" The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing",happy
 The people are absolutely LOVELY,happy
" We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people",happy
" Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were",surprise
 And they all seem to really enjoy their city,happy
" They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it",happy
" And man, it is gorgeous",happy
" So many public spaces, parks museums, gardens",neutral
 There was a fabulous sense of community there,happy
 My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs',happy
" So we went across the street to the park, it was about 2:00 pm",neutral
" There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs",neutral
 We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle,neutral
" I thought: ""that's strange, what's that about?""",surprise
" We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down",neutral
 They were perfect for taking a catnap,neutral
" We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze",neutral
 so we did the same,neutral
" Had a little hour sleep, got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours",neutral
 What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park?,neutral
 Vive la France!,happy
 We really had a ball in Paris,happy
" We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour",happy
" The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it",surprise
 6 were petty thieves and the seventh was a boy whose father had sent him there for a few weeks as  disciplinary measure,neutral
 Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps,neutral
 On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit,happy
" Upon arrival back in the states, we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert, which was my birthday present from Lance",neutral
" Thus, is my two year Grande Tour at an end",neutral
" I've returned ready for a fresh start, collecting new experiences on this side of the pond",neutral
" The last few weeks I've been in Lubbock, trying to readjust to life in America and spending lots of time with my family",neutral
" It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well",happy
 It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time,happy
 And though my European adventure is over (for the moment) my American one starts tomorrow,neutral
" I'm moving to Chicago Sunday morning, in the hopes of getting started there as an director and performer",neutral
" I'm excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there",happy
 There was  a lot to pack in,neutral
" I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming (rapidly approaching) holiday season!",happy
" I'll be in New York for New Year's, so if you're going to be in that area, let me know and we'll ring it in together",neutral
" I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season",happy
 All the best till we meet again!,neutral
 So,neutral

 Yeah,neutral
 My classes all seem fine,neutral
" But math just sucks, and I've accepted that",disgust
" Some of my teachers seem quite amazing, and others I know for a fact to be amazing",surprise
" So, all-in-all, pretty good, right?",happy
" Now, I see him all the time, and I'm pretty sure he'll be right outside the door my photography room after class every day for the rest of this trimester",neutral
" Unless Brandon and Meg break up, that is",neutral
" I also found out that Junior year, will, in fact, be a bitch",disgust
" Ah, well",neutral
 It's nothing a strong woman such as myself cannot handle with a little bit of DragonForce and mental pep talks,neutral

" at least they punched holes in it) that is my BIO lab course ""book",neutral
" What's even worse, it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off, so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all, which is often impossible because so much is left out",angry

 I forgot how demeaning BME classes are,angry
 Dr,neutral
 I haven't,neutral
" Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in, and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through",surprise
" Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major, there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree",neutral
" I mean, we already need 133 (ish) hours to graduate which, for you non college people, is about 8-10 more than any engineering major and more than that more for a non engineering major",neutral
" In addition to that, we keep encountering classes where the professor expects you to have taken general classes that you haven't (the anatomy/physiology is one, and thermodynamics is another one that Matt is having a problem with)",neutral
 I need to find a good time/place where I can go pray and unwind,neutral

" My mortality is nothing new, but I constantly have to ponder what I desire to take, achieve, or feel in this life",neutral

 what is happiness,neutral
 can you buy it?,neutral
 can it be sold?,neutral
 can you get there and back on a half tank of gas?,neutral
 I think you can,neutral
 We are all essentially the same person,neutral
 other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another,neutral
 Theoretically,neutral
 we both have the same tools (a brain) so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity,neutral
 Simply because that is not where I have been directing my energy to,neutral
 The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose,surprise
 however most people don't exert the mental energy required to expand your train of thought,neutral
 I believe all brains start out with the same potential and the way they are grown and shaped determined how they operate on default for the rest of your life unless you do something about it,neutral
 Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain?,neutral
 They look at things only on the surface and read into nothing,neutral
 Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep,neutral
 more often you find things to bring you down or worry about,sad
 A single lightning bolt from the sky can make a lifetime of panic and worry all worthless,fear
 I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees,neutral
 Whatever thought can be imagined - someone has taken that to the extreme,neutral
 True wisdom is growing your brain in all directions,neutral
 Life is finding the balance between compulsion and carelessness,neutral
 I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance,happy
 the perfect combination of all attributes,neutral
 the combination of all people balanced into one,neutral
 as defined by the dictionary,neutral
 Balanced,neutral
 (of a person or state of mind) having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality,neutral
 but when you try to become your own mental chemist - ingesting chemicals to alter your feelings - you screw up the balance,neutral
 This phenomenon can best be seen and proved with steroid users,neutral
 The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system,neutral
 The body is lazy - if you provide something for it - it stops providing for itself,neutral
 For example - the more you use chapstick - the less your lips produce their own moisture - making you further dependent on chapstick,neutral
 So while Cliche it is true,neutral
 the Happiness they bring is only temporary,happy
 Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment,happy
 First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week,angry
 Second of all she is laughing hysterically because she had to put her dog on doggie drugs because the dog learned how to open the window to get out and seems to be jewish because she likes the temple down the road,happy
" Third she starts asking why I have only posted pics, so my dear sister, this is for you",neutral
 She wouldn;t come down today so instead of being bored out of my mind I went antiquing,neutral
 I figure I have a couple extra bucks so I budget a certain amount,neutral
" Ok, I spent 4 times what I budgeted, but I wanted that desk",neutral
" I almost bought this cool shiney glass ""tumbler up"" thingy",neutral
" I was dragged away, (it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone)",neutral
" Ok, the alignment was out on her BMW when she bought it and it wiped out the tires",neutral
" She didn;t give the dealer a chance to correct the problem, she paid a astronomical amount for new tires without telling the dealer and expected the dealer to reimburse her the full amount",neutral
 I tend to think not,neutral
 She said that a mechanic told her that the frame was bent,neutral
 A shock mount was bad,neutral
 I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required,neutral

 I got her less than $500,neutral

" So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report, he will understand why I appear not to take her side",neutral

 Cook up lamb for gyros,neutral

 They all complimented on it,happy
 Killin me he is,happy
" Well, what can I say, he has a great kitchen, and the best cooking stuff, he doesn't even cook",neutral
" Ok, I've said enough",neutral
 I need to figure what I'm going to throw out so I can move that desk from the middle of the dining room to one of the 2 rooms upstairs I occupy,neutral
 Our emotions are a gift from God,neutral
 But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet,neutral
" For instance, if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met",sad
" On the otherhand, if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met",happy
" How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted, judged, criticized, blamed or physically hurt someone?",angry
 Probably too many to count,neutral
 We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate,sad
 We can become conscious of what is going on inside us,neutral
 Once we put our finger on the emotion we are feeling we can then go on to vocalize it,neutral
" Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication, has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model",neutral
" Part of that model involves asking the question, ""I am feeling _______ because I am needing ______",neutral
" Rosenberg also calls this four step process ""giraffe language",neutral
 He coined it giraffe language because the giraffe has the largest heart of all the mammals,neutral
 The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around,neutral
" The idea is that Nonviolent communication, which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart",neutral
 By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them,angry
 We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need,neutral
 When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them,angry
" We can ask them, ""Are you feeling ______ because you are needing _______?""",neutral
 If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation,neutral
 By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation,neutral
 We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them,neutral
 It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict,neutral
" For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down",angry
" Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others",neutral
 Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves,angry

 Though I was allowed to stay up until 1 AM last night,neutral
" But heh, thats basically it",neutral
 Theres nothing left to say so this is the end of my journal entry,neutral
 Well short one anyway,neutral
 This is my update for today and I am off,neutral
" It's yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying 'hey, hold on a second!'",neutral
 It's the veils,neutral
" Yes, the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear",neutral
" I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights, just to give a bit of perspective",neutral
 Listen,neutral
 I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts,neutral
 Let's clarify,neutral
 Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck,neutral
" The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all",neutral
 Taleban style if you will,neutral
 This is called the nikab,neutral
 For clarification the difference should be noted,neutral
 And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down,neutral
 The khimar is the actual headscarf,neutral
 The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab,neutral
" Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf",neutral
" The nikab, or taliban style cover, is not an Islamic practice",neutral
" A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies)",neutral
 It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities,angry
" Whether the French will ever admit it or not, they have a serious racism problem - and its aimed mainly at Muslims and Africans",neutral
" The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population",sad
" The Brits, famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans, have began treading in this murky water",neutral
" Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils, or nikabs, in the UK",neutral
 Not the ban on hijabs,neutral
" The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this",angry
 And I'm afraid it could get ugly,fear
 But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr,neutral
 He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community,neutral
" It shouldn't, he added, be decided by a group of old white male politicians",neutral
 Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this,neutral
 I'm by no means an expert on veils,neutral
" What i do know is that there are many, many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes",neutral
 Most of the European peasantry covered themselves with a headscarf just a hundred years ago and can still be found in christian villages throughout eastern and southern europe,neutral
 It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world 'oblige' their women to wear the veil,neutral
 So the voluntary and involuntary,neutral
" France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out",neutral
 Turkey has a similar issue,neutral
" In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union, it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities",neutral
 Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish,neutral
" It is Europe's largest 'indigenous' Muslim population, all of whom are white Europeans and embrace European principles",neutral
" Bosnian Islam is very secular, and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU",neutral
 The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia,neutral
" The hijab is accepted and tolerated, as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women)",neutral
 The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west,neutral
 The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of 'indigenous' white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies,fear
 This door has to swing both ways,neutral
 Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities,fear
" If western women can run around half naked, can eastern women completely cover themselves?",neutral
 Is there really a difference?,neutral
 There is no black and white my friends,neutral
 We all need to take the veils off,neutral
 and look at each other eye to eye,neutral
 I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday,sad

" She knew the kitty was not doing well (she hasn't been for a while now, but kept rallying), so it wasn't a shock at all, but still sad",sad
" She had been looking at having to have her PTS before she leaves for Africa, but I guess Aunt Becky had other ideas",neutral
 Aunt Becky was sent over the bridge in a traditional Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa) ceremony,neutral

 Please just pray for me and the trip and the other people who are going (I'm not sure who yet so I shall keep it on the DL,neutral
 lol),happy
 I just feel like we're all getting caught in the whirlpool of life (hehe what a funny term) and I just wanted to urge you guys to not forget about checking up on each other,happy
" Sometimes, all we need is that little encouragement or motivation to get us going again",neutral
 like the energizer bunny!!!,neutral
 :D lol wow,happy
" Besides from that random addition by my kooky self I hope you know what I'm trying to get at, because I know for me, that's how it is",neutral
 Okay that's about it for now,neutral
" First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of myself",happy
" What I completed in one day today, was not possible to me last week",neutral
 I decided then and there that I would take advantage of the situation and teach the class,neutral
" I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over, and of course he complied",neutral
" I figured I knew the material more than he did, and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run",neutral
" So the bell rang, the sub introduced himself and I took over",neutral
" After they turned that in, I introduced ""Poor Richard's Almanac,"" which we read as a class",neutral
 This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading,neutral
 They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions,neutral
 The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me,surprise
" On the other hand, I did know that today I was to teach a full period lesson to my freshmen for periods 3 &amp; 6",neutral
" For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition, an example, and a story out of their literature books",neutral
" I explained to them that the ""mood"" of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author",neutral
" To give them a better understanding of how ""mood"" works, I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead",neutral
" After I was done reading my paragraph, I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created",neutral
" Almost everyone participated, and for every type of mood they came up with, I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood",neutral
 That was a segway into today's story,neutral
" Today we read, ""The Talk"" by Gary Soto",neutral
 I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began,neutral
" I read the first paragraph, then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading",neutral
" After certain spots, I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along",neutral
" At the end of the story, I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood",neutral
" After a discussion, I asked them to take out a piece of paper",neutral
" I had them answer a question along the lines of, ""how would the mood of the story have been different if Soto wrote this as a child?""",neutral
 This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 &amp; 6,neutral
" Wow, I hardly ever have plans",surprise
" I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning, and was gone almost all day, and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight",neutral

 I'm enough of a grown-up to say it,neutral

 So 12 cops to investigate ONE car break in,neutral
" They all fly off in EVERY direction to find this kid (of course, except the direction I said he went)",neutral

 I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye,surprise
 not that I had 4 months off in the end,neutral
" So far I have done zip camping, no trips to the lake",neutral
 I have been quite preoccupied though so I can't blame my lack of summer fun on laziness,neutral
 I  am getting so tired of this studying for my securities exam,neutral
 just once I would love to not have to worry about that sort of thing,happy
 and to have more than 2 weeks of vacation time,neutral
 but this is life and we must not forget that like is not a holiday,neutral
 I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI,neutral
 Should be interesting,happy
 At least that is one issue that has finally gotten rolliing,neutral
 I was beginning to worry I'de have to put it off for yet another term,fear
 I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times,neutral

 hey I'll be a rich individual,happy
 whoot,happy
 I'm really in it just for the money ;),happy
 actually I just want to give the opportunity a chance,neutral
 I have nothing to lose,neutral
 it  gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now,neutral
 Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it,neutral
 Worry gains you no more minutes to  your life,fear
 rather it steals what precious ones you have left,neutral
 and stress,sad
 we have no one to blame but our selves,neutral
 society has become just one big stress pool,sad
" Our conversations with family, friends, co-workers etc",disgust
 where I am going with this I have no clue,neutral
" I don't have a plan, I don't know what I want in the long run",neutral
 I'm just taking it as it comes,neutral
" I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart",sad
" To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life",sad
" being alienated, being alone",sad
" I can only take so much of her though, for her sake and mine :)",neutral
" I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life",surprise
 but they make my time at work memorable,happy
" I have put my life in the hands of god, and left him to it",neutral
 I frankly would be just as happy alone,happy
 maybe more so,neutral
 I needed to start over new,neutral
 They are better off where they are now,neutral
 we are all moving forward on our own path,neutral
 hopefully the right one,neutral
" I have a list of things I want to do during my time, and each day I add something new to it",neutral
" lol, lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it",happy
" it says a lot, even if it was written by a comedian",neutral
" A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low",neutral
" I guess I fit the group the article refers to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the ""support mechanism"" category, if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well",neutral
" One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow",sad
" I definitely feel like, moreso than any other time in my life, I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends",neutral
" I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever",sad
" On a ""big picture"" scale, I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old, now a scary half-a-lifetime ago",fear
" If I didn't have the desire to be better than what I currently am, would I have impetus to keep living at all?",neutral
 I hope not,neutral
" As far as ""support mechanisms"" go, I've seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach",neutral
" Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it",happy
" I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time, at least",happy
" if the goals are similar, which one would you prefer to be?",neutral
" It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you, especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful",neutral
 I know I'm guilty of that all the time,sad
 Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain,sad
" Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened",sad
" It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so",disgust
 So what does this mean to me then?,neutral
 It means I have some tough choices to make,neutral
" Is it worth it, or is it better to just let fate play out its' hand and look for a new deal?",neutral
 There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless,neutral
" I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it's not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried",neutral
" If being a friend isn't about trying, then I've been taking the wrong approach all along",neutral
" As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me",angry
 I love them,happy
 GOD are they annoying me,angry
" I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears",angry
 My only plausible explanation is that I want out,neutral
" No matter how much I love them, I want to be independent and living on my own, providing for myself and on the road to success",neutral
" Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever",angry
" I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free",neutral
 Frenchie Fucked Off,disgust
" Lots of angry costomers with half finished work, a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business",angry
" Oh yeah, and the best part:",neutral
" I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues (errors on pages) and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday!!",angry
" Further to that by the way, I did speak to him about it further when he said ""My new food is making me feel really healthy"" - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it, and then gone out to dinner, and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend",happy
" He's paying $250 a week to eat food, and then eat again",neutral
" But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time",surprise
 The look on my face I think said it all,surprise
" This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1",surprise
" ""I choose to do more important things with my time",neutral
 great life choices right there,disgust
 Urgh,disgust
" I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy ""I don't have to do anything"" option",angry
" If I could afford the food, I would probably do it myself, but Jenny Craig was expensive enough, and that was $100 a week, not $250, and I didn't have a mortgage then",neutral
" But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy",disgust
 AARRGGHH!!!,angry
" Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him",angry
" She slams on her brakes, stops her car, right in front of me, in the middle of the street, and gets out",angry
 Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me,angry
" ""YOU LIKE ALMOST HIT ME OMG",angry
" I'm not very nice, not when facing death",angry
" "" She threatened",angry
" I must admit, I was kind of fascinated by the way her eyes, rimmed in black eyeliner, managed to stay so wide open like that",surprise
 It went on like that for a good minute,neutral
 Finally I got fed up,disgust
 I tried to bike away- what was she gonna do?,neutral
 Write down my licensce plate?,neutral
 THis was when the Princess turned into some sort of psychobitch from hell,disgust
 I guess someone forgot her midol,neutral
" She grabbed the handlebars of my bike, and tried to push me off",angry
" Now, people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection",angry
 We're struggling with my bike,neutral
 I got mad,angry
" Now, when one says you, ""hit like a girl"" take it as a compliment",neutral
 I hit that bitch so hard,angry
" hey, she assulted me",angry
 and I was on a fucking BIKE,angry
 fucking A,angry
 And I found out in the most annoying way,disgust
" I woke up on Wednesday morning, bright and early (as I do) to go into work/uni",neutral
 I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on,surprise
" Now I thought at first that maybe it had broken the night before, after I'd gone to bed or something",neutral
" But then one of my housemates, who was already up, informed me that no, it was that the electricity wasn't working anywhere in the house",neutral
" Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment, and then suddenly back off",neutral
 We tried everything to make sure it wasn't the plug/circuit itself,neutral
" But no, it was the fridge",neutral
" We thought for a while about what to do, not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one",neutral
" At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves, but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues",sad
 In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend (love you heaps babes!),happy
 offered to give us her fridge (woooo!),happy
" So, we've now gone over 48 hours without a fridge (hate to think what half our food is like in there!)",disgust
 but will joyfully be picking the other one up today,happy
 Wooo!,happy
 In other news I have 6 days to go (including today) before I leave!,neutral
 YAY!,happy
" As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters",neutral
" Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November",angry
" An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks, however, has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th",neutral
" Well, maybe",neutral
" As noted in the latest issue of US News &amp; World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power",happy
" The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies, which highlights polling (granted, six-week old polling) showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls",neutral
 Is this spin or is it true?,neutral
" Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly",neutral
" In other words, the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season: persuade everyone you can, turn out your base, and assume all the other guy's usual folks will vote",neutral
" In other words Democrats, work like hell until November 7th",neutral
 i feel like i could fly,neutral
 ive come to realise also how different i am with him,neutral
" not different me or anything, different in how i am in OUR relationship, compared to my others",neutral
 and im sure he's been doing the same,neutral
" and we're both being the best we can for each other, and it shows, and it pays off",neutral
 we're friends and lovers and everything inbetween that,happy
 we have come such a far way in such a short time and i look forward to every other moment i will share with him,neutral

" i better not, considering the circumstances",neutral
" so no i wont have my head too high up my ass about it, but im noot going to sit here and think/dread it everyday either",fear

" stephen was a little abusive, mainly with words and feelings directed at me / to make me feel bad",sad
" chris had a problem with words too,and his anger",angry
 he could car eless about anything and everything as long as he got his way everything was alright,neutral
 other than that hed get offended or pissed off or ignorant about it,angry

 After church I went to one of my best friend's house for lunch,neutral
 My mother was invited too,neutral
 I saw the guy I went to a dance with once back at school there at her house,neutral
 Haven't seen him in ages,surprise
 Goes figure he'd be there,neutral
" Hm, was a bit weird",surprise
 Anyhow not important though,neutral
 We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream!,happy
" (However you spell the Genelli part) Ah, we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited, cos her dad kept him busy most of the day",angry
 Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad,angry
" ""Whahahaha"" I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush",happy
 W0rd!,neutral
 That was funny,happy
 Everyone at the table was giggeling,happy
 Her niece and Lizelle came along,neutral
" We went in my car, cos apparently I have music",neutral
" :P I drive well now though, yep I do!",neutral
 but don't think they would let you do that,neutral
 NooooOOoo,neutral
 Now that was fun,happy
 I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean,neutral
 The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly!,neutral
 Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves,neutral
 You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program,neutral
 Funny photo's came out there,happy
" I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders, but there were none!",neutral
 =/ And some guy on a prepelled engine driven kite thing that was in the air,neutral
 o,neutral
" I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them, especially like action photo's!",neutral
 LOVE IT!,happy
 It is like doing my art,neutral
 I get lost in it,neutral
 Hmmm,neutral
 Coffeee and dark chocolate!,happy
 Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what,neutral
 We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do,neutral
 We almost sat there for an hour,neutral
 Lizelle didn't want to go to church,neutral
 That was as clear as daylight,neutral
 Hm,neutral
 Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie,sad
 what do you pick,neutral
" (Non-christians, don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts, doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person, just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me",neutral
 :p,neutral
 They went to the movies afterwards,neutral
" Didn't think she would do it, but hey!",surprise
 I sat there drawing and uhm the phone rang and it was the police,neutral
 Ye,neutral
 will finish later,neutral
" If you were given the choice between life and death, which one would you choose?",neutral
 The choice does seem quite  obvious to me,neutral
 Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left?,neutral
 So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them,neutral
 Imagine you are young and healthy,neutral
 An athelete,neutral
 The whole world and it's endless possibilities are  stretched out before you,neutral
 You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you,happy
 All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first,neutral
 Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction,surprise
" Think constant arguing,  lies and deception, money mismanagement, and infidelity",angry
 So you decide to join the military,neutral
" You figure, 'Hey, I might as well use this opportunity to see the world, make some money, and get an education and a marketable skill",neutral
 The world is still yours for the taking,neutral
 So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical,neutral
 Everything goes well with the interview,neutral
 The recruiter tells you that the technology field in which you are interested is growing rapidly and there are all types of jobs available that you can parlay into a lucrative career once you retire from the service,neutral
 You leave there with a renewed sense of purpose and vow to take full advantage of this experience,neutral
 The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment,sad
" You think to yourself that maybe you had too many traffic tickets, or maybe there was something small in your past that has presented you from being selected to join the military",neutral
 The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable,neutral
 You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move,sad
" He begins to speak while you're planning, ""I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok, I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree",sad
" ), but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forces(or I could do some traveling and explore the country",neutral
" We have the results from your physical(I know, I'm gonna do some volunteer work with kids in the community",neutral
 So what do you do?,neutral
" This is the story as it was given to me, and when I heard it I was pissed",disgust
" First, because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story",neutral
" See, I knew he had cheated",neutral
 So imagine my surprise  when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where,surprise
" She then tells me that she's gonna test me for gonorrhea, but also that she's gonna have to test me for HIV",neutral
" I'm like, ""For what?""",surprise
" She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea, what makes me think that person didn't have anything else?",neutral
" Really, what did make me think that?",surprise
" I would have given this man, who obviously had little regard for me, my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies",disgust
" Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV",happy
" I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time",happy
 I realized that my life belongs to me,disgust
" The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking",angry
 He never went to see an infectious disease specialist,neutral
" He partied just as hard as I did, drank and smoked just as much weed as me",neutral
" When we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the most part",neutral
" I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics",neutral
 Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way,neutral
 I wonder what changed his mind about that?,surprise
" Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex?",neutral
" I've asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer",neutral
 I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made,neutral
 So what would you do?,neutral
" Would you choose to live, or would you choose to die?",neutral
" The question itself is mostly rhetorical, presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response",neutral
" However, if you are so compelled to do so, please leave your thoughts and comments",neutral
 All will be greatly appreciated,neutral

 I've been thinking a great deal about the importance of ritual,neutral
" Not religious ritual (like baptism) or societal ritual (like shaking hands), but personal ritual",neutral
 I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut,neutral
" Granted, not the global, world-issues Big Picture, just MY Big Picture",neutral
" The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf, blowing about in the wind",neutral
 Like that bag in American Beauty,neutral
 it was not self-determined,neutral
 I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose,neutral
 How do I do that?,neutral
 And how can I start now?,neutral
" And, the corollary: how easy it is to slip into old habits, once back at home",neutral
 [It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live,neutral
 and then eventually have to return home to old triggers,neutral
 So anyway,neutral
 Ritual,neutral
 Rut,neutral
" That, and they may not be exactly great for you",neutral
 But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual,fear
 At least in my experience,neutral
 I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy,neutral
" but alas, they aren't (yet)",sad
" * Every day when I come home from work, the first thing I do is put on my pajamas",neutral
 Maybe that doesn't sound like a ritual,neutral
" but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy, that's definitely one of them",happy
" * Every other Saturday, Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures",neutral
 and we come away with the cutest toes ever!,neutral
 * A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer,happy
" * When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying",happy
" Maybe after this show ends, I'll be able to start a new garden",neutral
" I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals, that I really don't have many",neutral
 How very telling,neutral
 This is not good,sad
" * I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream (I love to try new flavors!), but when it comes to ordering, it's always Mint Chip",happy
 and,neutral
 * My fear of insomnia keeps me from going to bed when I'm really tired,fear
 or just something totally mental that I do?,neutral
" Anyway, I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts",neutral
 How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives?,neutral
" ""The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one",sad

" I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator",neutral
" There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of",neutral
" Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby",neutral
" All of it in a building off the highway, malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it",neutral
" It was a hotel, on a road",neutral
" I went out for lunch with Chris and Gina Gagliano of First Second; food became curiously hard to find within hiking distance (in the interests of full disclosure, my mastery of direction also had us walking the wrong way for a good while)",neutral
 But we didn't hang around,neutral
" We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people, followed close behind by haunted ponies who'd just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics",neutral
" I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you",happy
" Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness",neutral
" A diverse audience too, everything from young to old, from old-school nerds to stylish-looking folk, from aged hippies to teenage Goths",neutral
" To look only at this crowd, you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience",neutral
" I went to two panels, Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's",neutral
" There was nowhere to sit in the former, since I got there late, so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance",neutral
" At one point, McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists, all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board",neutral
" Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered ""It's just like Civil War",neutral
" Afterward (a solid half-hour afterward, I believe), McCloud could be seen out in the hallway, taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs",neutral
" The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room",happy
" Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around",neutral
 And I bought a good deal of stuff too,neutral
" I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn't quite hold",neutral
" I managed to get through the whole show without finding anything I really wanted sold out, however, and I only had to stand in the Line of Shame at the ATM once",neutral
 BOOKS I GOT:,neutral
" Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch (debuted at the show, a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon)",neutral
" Awakening Comics #1-2 by Steve Peters &amp; friends (I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table, and indeed the entire convention, I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect!)",surprise
" Cinema Sewer #19 edited by Robin Bougie (new issue of the funny, comics-heavy pamphlet-format magazine devoted entirely to the finest in exploitation and pornographic film - a creator's personality-powered publication, and I assure you that Robin Bougie is in real life exactly the way he portrays himself in the mag)",neutral
" Cold Heat #1-2 (of 12) by Ben Jones &amp; Frank Santoro (#2 debuted at the show; the odd, semi-abstract fantasy/action book that Diamond initially disliked a while back, complaining of its format despite the fact that it's 100% a serialized pamphlet-format comic)",neutral
" Comics Comics #1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler &amp; Dan Nadel (I mentioned this yesterday, but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue #1)",neutral
 Ed the Happy Clown #2 (of 9) by Chester Brown (the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?!),neutral
" Fuzz &amp; Pluck in Splitsville #4 (of 5) by Ted Stearn (surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz &amp; Pluck; still, I've never seen this in a store, though Fantagraphics had it at their table)",neutral
" House of Twelve, at the movies Vol",neutral
" 2 #1: Heavy Metal by various (from House of Twelve, a free giveaway show debut, parodying the original movie version of the magazine)",neutral
" New Tales of Old Palomar #1 (of 3) by Gilbert Hernandez (new miniseries of stand-alone tales, presented in the Ignatz format, debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men)",neutral
" Ninja by Brian Chippendale (debuted at the show, probably the book of the show, and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table, he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured ""I want to make a book like this!"")",neutral
" Paping #11 by various (older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though)",neutral
" Project: Romantic by various (debuted at the show, the newest in AdHouse's Project series of anthologies, this one strictly devoted to romance comics)",neutral
 Pulphope,neutral
 R,neutral
" Kelly's ""Trapped in the Closet"" Starring Batman (Abridged) by K",neutral

" I'm not leveled up yet, no sir",neutral
 My Mother Is A Fish,neutral
 Do you know some tiger sharks sleep?,neutral
" I think it's in the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of California, I can't remember which, but there's so much oxygen in the water they actually sleep",neutral
 I don't sleep,neutral
" No, it's alright, I've had a lot of time to come to terms with this",neutral
" Some of my girlfriends have found it a little strange; I think it's one of the reasons they break up with me in the end, as if they need anymore reasons",surprise
" I just lay in the bed next to them while they snore, or they breathe softly, or they dream, or they do whatever it is sleeping people do",neutral
" Most of the time, I sit in a chair",neutral
" To try and remedy this, I spend my nights reading",neutral
 I just finished a book about the importance of dreams,neutral
 How important can they be?,neutral
 I don't have them and I'm still here,neutral
" But it was a good read, and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother, well, now I'd know what it means",happy
" Sometimes, I can't reading about this condition, though",neutral
 I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it,neutral
 I didn't always have this problem,neutral
 When I was a kid I slept,neutral
 I think,neutral
 All this not sleeping has a terrible way of playing with your memory,neutral
 I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably,neutral
" Just me in my room, reading my books and wondering what life would be like if I slept",neutral
 Do I go to work again tomorrow morning?,neutral
 I think I do,neutral
" It's Sunday, but tomorrow might be a holiday",neutral
" It is, isn't it?",neutral
 But I think I work on that holiday,neutral
 How else would I keep all these days straight?,neutral
 It's not like a sleep in on the weekend,neutral
" I can't always read about this condition, or whatever it may be",neutral
" Otherwise, I'm a totally healthy male of my species",neutral
" I weigh about 180 lbs, I'm about 5', 10"", I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me",surprise
 Something from when I was a kid,neutral
 An accident,neutral
 And there's the scar on my lip,neutral
 I don't know where that came from,neutral
" I would say it was from some drunken night of excess, but I've never blacked out either",neutral
" Oh, I get drunk, but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget",neutral
" I remember every second, every horrific moment leaning over a toilet and puking",fear
" It's unfair that I can remember things like that so well, yet I can't even tell you much about what happened in the rest of my life",neutral
" Selective memory, they say",neutral
" You'd think that'd be a problem at work, but it's menial stuff",neutral
 Doesn't require much of a brain to do it,neutral
" I spend most of my time in my cube typing and filing, thinking about what I read the night before, trying to process it, trying to figure out what is/has been happening to me",neutral
 Have you ever read it?,neutral
 It's kind of confusing,neutral
 I kept having to reread passages until I figured out that it's not chronological,neutral
 But I can't remember it right now,neutral
" I'm at work, and I left the book at home",neutral
 I'll have to look when I get home,neutral
 Unless I returned it to the library,neutral
" It's a couple miles, but I don't have a lot of people that I have to rush home to see",neutral
 Just my books these days,neutral
 My walk takes me by Lake Calhoun,neutral
" Every so often, I walk around it",neutral
" A shelf of clouds cover the sky, and Calhoun, choppy from the breeze, glitters only slightly",neutral
 I itch my neck for some reason it itches,neutral
" Soon the lake will be frozen, everyone walking on top of it",neutral
 I don't get it,neutral
 Just like the fisherman,neutral
" Doesn't seem fair, not at all",neutral
" I amble around the lake, and the people are slowly thinning out",neutral
" I, on the other hand, have nothing to go home to",sad
 I should have brought a book with me,neutral
 I suppose the cold should annoy me.  I begin to take off my shoes,disgust
 People tell me that the water in the lakes around here isn't that good,neutral
" But people swim in this, right?",neutral
 The water can't be that bad,neutral
 People stare as I dangle my feet into the lake in October,surprise
" No one is in the lake, and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me",neutral
 I control it at first,neutral
" A person walks by me and says something, but I don't know what, and I'm singing something, but I can't place to tune",neutral
 Something my mother sang to me to put me to sleep,neutral
 I think,neutral
 I could be wrong,neutral
" I don't listen to music, but I know this song",neutral
 Vardaman is right,neutral
 I quickly strip,neutral
 I can see people running at me as I dive into Calhoun,neutral
" My neck tingles as I hit the water and I sink, blowing bubbles",neutral
" They slowly stop coming out of my mouth, but my neck continues to tingle",neutral
 I read somewhere that fish don't sleep,neutral
 Except for some tiger sharks,neutral
" You're going to hear that a lot from me in the coming weeks, I think",neutral
 Work was fucked up,disgust
 Like Alice in Wonderland on a bad acid trip fucked up,disgust
" Mind you, I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks, and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it",angry
" But it's all good when folks need or want something, isn't it?",neutral
" And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom, and suddenly, I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die",sad
 And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home,angry
 December 1st,neutral
 Must. Eyes. Prize,neutral
" But for now, I go hide",neutral
 So,neutral
" I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn, a UVM student",sad
 It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it,sad
 I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked,surprise
 I transferred from a school in an unsafe part of a city to UVM and found it to be much more laid back and free,neutral
 Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad,sad
 I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part,sad
" Anyways, I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over",neutral
 Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time,neutral
 Work and school are getting a little intense but I've found that I can do it- I just need to stay focused,neutral
 My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (how),surprise
 and I am excited about the little booger haha,happy
" Okay, off to clean this room",neutral
 Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it,neutral
 It needs a serious pick up and vacuum,neutral
 My mom would be so proud of me,happy
" cold, rainy day",neutral
 i took Shelby again,neutral
 i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning,surprise
" once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy, darting all over the place, picking up stones, randomly chewing on tree roots, etc",neutral
" back at the car, T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her",neutral
 i was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off,surprise
 T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix,neutral
" he was a stray, found wandering Discovery Park",neutral
 he has a bad left eye which i don't think he has any vision,neutral
 i ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released (no one came to claim him) and allowed to go for a run,neutral

" Along the way, Christina, Kevan, Eff, and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions",neutral
" Two hours with Kevan, I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd",neutral

 Then we met him,neutral
 I question that too,neutral

 This was after we finished a 6 mile walk,neutral

 I am going to do the AIDS walk again next year for fun,happy
 Interact ended up being a whole ton better than I had expected,neutral
" That's all for now, I have homework",neutral
" I stand barefoot by the ocean's edge, my feet sinking slowly, being sucked beneath the surface of the cool, wet sand",neutral
 I am planted there,neutral
 Head tilted back,neutral
" enormous mounds of gray cotton batting clouds, only momentarily visible as they are back-lit by silent, random flashbulbs",neutral
 The sand wrapping my feet is now warmer than the air,neutral
" Slightly swaying with the breeze, I can feel the deep vibration moving through me.   and away",neutral
 Being the tallest object on the beach in a thunderstorm and living to write about it,neutral
 Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend,neutral
 Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend,neutral
" Regardless of my temporal status as far as my brother is concerned, time still moves ahead at a frighteningly rapid pace",fear
" Speaking of time, this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business",neutral
 I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD,neutral
 Once I have them all then I think I'll start on Blackadder,neutral
 I'm sorry but British television rules,neutral
" I spent the majority of the day up in Madison (hi Robby, I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is)",neutral
 Their historical society was having a century home tour as a fund raiser and my mother wanted to go,neutral
 I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us,surprise
 Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is,neutral
" On the plus side, the home tour put me in the holiday spirit",happy
" I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals, however, if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly",neutral
 It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90,neutral
" And on that note, enjoy the remainder of your Sunday",happy
" Well, we're half-way through our trip",neutral
 I can't believe it!,surprise
 It's amazing,happy
 Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence,neutral
 We'll sightsee there and then take another train to Venice in the evening,neutral
 From there it's on to Switzerland and then France,neutral
 Wow,happy
 There is a church or ruins everywhere you look,neutral
 The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome,happy
 Yesterday (Saturday) was spent at Vatican City,neutral
 To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait,neutral
 The lines around the wall was insanely long,neutral
" In October the Museums close quite early (1:20pm), so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things",neutral
" I would have loved to see the Library, but we didn't get to it",neutral
" There was so much to look at, I just couldn't take it all in",neutral
 At all,neutral
 After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St,neutral
 We walked around pretty much the entire city until we found it,neutral
" Again, we stood in line to enter the church",neutral
" Didn't have to wait too long, though",neutral
 Inside was stunning- and FULL of people,surprise
 And then we realized- there was Mass going on!,surprise
 I can't believe they do that!,surprise
 It's so rude!,disgust

 It's pretty cool,happy
" So anyway, Rome in general was loud, dirty and absolutely chock-full of people and cars and bikes",disgust
" I've been trying not to think about my life back home, but sometimes it sneaks in, uninvited",neutral
 What the hell am I going to do when I get back home?,angry
 Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem?,neutral
 These questions completely depress me,sad
" what really happened was that an earthquake started and instead of waking up first i incorporated it into a dream where i was watching a documentary about earthquakes and they were ""recounting"" some classic earthquake showing how it would pulse stronger and stronger",neutral
" i was very attentive, and it didn't seem like she was gonna break, so i just stayed there and eventually it stopped and i passed out again",neutral
" then he calls again and, knowing that's the international sign for ""pick up the frickin' phone,"" i picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him",angry

" so i went back to sleep 'till noon, took beau for a walk, surfed for four hours, cooked in the dark, read by candlelight for a little while, adn then the power came back on so i could watch tv",neutral
" all in all, an interesting sunday",happy
 all my plans were shot to shit 'cause the cell waves were all packed and i couldn't get in touch with my friends very well,disgust
 and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help,neutral
 yeah,neutral
 useless day,disgust
" then i needed a drink and naturally don't have beer, and i expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm",neutral
 so i made a martini,neutral
 that i'm still trying to finish,neutral
 this fuckers don't go down too easy,angry
" oh, earthquake was rated highest at a 6",neutral
 hum,neutral
 definitely in the audible range and very regular,neutral
 then it would relax again,neutral
 but yeah,neutral
 didn't rumble like,neutral
 say,neutral
 an avalanche (movie sounds) or rock slide,neutral
 or how they make them sound in movies,neutral
 it hummed,neutral
 the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous,surprise
" Earlier this week, Karina had invited me over to her townhouse",neutral
" She said that Kubik would be hanging out, and I could come if I wanted",neutral
" I got there a little after 7, Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo, and I asked, ""Where's Kubik?"" because she's usually very punctual",neutral
" I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina, and while she's talking, a face appears in the window behind her, grinning and waving enthusiastically",happy
" I jump, shrieking a little before I realize it's only Kubik",surprise
" Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito, and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier",neutral
" Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses, red peppers, crackers, and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway",neutral
" Original plan was to watch Brokeback Mountain, but I saw that 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate is on, and ask if we can watch that",neutral
" The two of them watch it, I half watch the movie while reading the newspaper, sometimes out loud, but Kubik complains, ""SOMEONE IS TALKING while I'm trying to watch a movie!!"" but Karina defends me, ""You're one to talk",neutral
" We watch Project Runway, but the repetition of the same 5 commercials becomes old fast",neutral
" Haha, except nicer",happy
" Sunday afternoon, Erica, Diana, and I are going to the Spy Museum",neutral
" As I'm walking to the metro station, a teenage boy in his mixed group of 4 or 5 friends hanging outside yells, ""I like your haircut!"" and I answer, ""Thanks,"" while I keep walking having seen Erica and Diana enter a little bit earlier",neutral
 A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day,happy
" The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there, in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families",surprise
" I'm the slowest to go through the exhibits, and I soon lose Erica and Diana, occasionally catching up with them when they slow down",neutral
" On the first floor, they have a crawlspace you can go through",neutral
" While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices, this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet, ""You dropped this",neutral
" Later, there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up, but our timing is never quite right",neutral
 We stop in the gift shop before heading home,neutral
" Diana finds a book, and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family",neutral
" The wind blows strongly outside, and Diana has a hard time pushing open the door, but a 7 or 8 year old boy who's already exited with his family helps her out by pulling while she pushes",neutral
 I woke up early and checked on my little Chirp,neutral
 It was cute,happy
 I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her,neutral
" She is looking better than she did, but hasn't eaten anything, so I hope she continues to heal",neutral
" I had to fly out the door this morning and ended up being 10 minutes late for class, but we were doing a group project, so I dived in and did my part",neutral

 I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics,neutral

 Went home and finished the luncheon posters than I had to leave early for my eye appointment,neutral

 Something strong,neutral
 What I really meant to say,neutral

 Maybe in a different light,neutral
 You could see me stand on my own again,neutral
 Cause now i can see,neutral
 Locked inside of me so deep,neutral
 I never really wanted you to go,neutral
 *huggles to you all*,happy
" As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed",happy
" The first was the dedication of a painting that was donated to the school by the students of Fr Damien Dietlein OSB, the Old Testament Professor there",neutral
 The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo (our name for Father) and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair,surprise
 The evening's speaker happened to be another of my professors: Fr,neutral
 Denis Robinson OSB whom I had for Early Church History and had been telling mrangelmeg about for months,neutral
 His topic was John Henry Newman and Catholic Education,neutral
 I really wanted mrangelmeg to have a chance to experience Fr,neutral
 Denis because he is a force with which to be reckoned,neutral
" After that discussion we spent some time in the little bar on campus which is called the Unstable ( Benedictines take a vow of stability, so they call the bar, the Unstable, get it?)",neutral
 visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not,neutral
" I do miss them so very much, though I don't miss class at all",sad
 We had a wonderful time,happy

 Welcome to the world of classical music,neutral
" It's my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure",happy
" It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization, and it dates back well into the Middle Ages",neutral
" Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let's study this music from one era to the next",neutral
" Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music, and since I recognize all seven, let's learn about each one:",neutral
1,neutral
" Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source",surprise
" There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming",neutral
 Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times,neutral
2,neutral
" Renaissance (1450 - 1600): Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts",neutral
" Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere",neutral
 Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church,neutral
 Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era,neutral
3,neutral
" Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano",neutral
" Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success",neutral
4,neutral
 Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow,neutral
" Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time",neutral
" You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing ""classical"")",neutral
" They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material",neutral
5,neutral
" Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions",neutral
" Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments",neutral
" Female composers gained more visibility during this period, such as Clara Schumann",neutral
6,neutral
" New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined",neutral
" Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything, including world wars, politics, SEX, and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz",neutral
" And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic",neutral
" Finally, music could be recorded and distributed widely, creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music",neutral
" Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel",neutral
" Needless to say, neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century",neutral
7,neutral
" Contemporary Classical: 1970 - 2050 (projected): If the 20th Century period ends in 1999, then what do we call all classical music written thereafter?",neutral
" That was painless, wasn't it?",neutral
 Your next few leaps into classical music should now be a little easier!,neutral
" Add a little passion to your life each time you visit, and share my world with me!",neutral
 Measure 40 amends the state constitution to require supreme court and appeals judges to be elected by district instead of the statewide vote that currently happens,neutral
 Arguments in favor: 29,neutral
 Arguments in opposition: 20,neutral
" 8 of the ""pro"" arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges",neutral
 Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments,neutral
" There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc",neutral
 One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton,neutral
" This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other",surprise
" As such I consider him to be primarily a politician, and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician, even when I agree with them",neutral
 They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up,neutral
" There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else",neutral
" So I'm leaning slightly in favor, although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference",neutral
" again, kerstin has proven to herself how she isn't who she wants to be yet",neutral
 finding this out is almost as fun as finding out the effects of placing one's hand down a working garbage disposal unit,happy
 i don't like making decisions b/c i don't want to make the wrong one,neutral
" there are no wrong decisions, only different outcomes!"" but i can't",neutral

 my paranoia really knows no bounds,fear
" found out my mother cut open the top of her left foot and got 11 stitches, good job mommy :D!",neutral

 so i was walking next to him and we were looking at one another,neutral
 and i held my head there for a while,neutral
 wow this kinda sounds like it going into a porno,neutral
 dont worry its not,neutral
 far from,neutral
 nothing else happened in the dream we just cuddled and it was real sweet,happy
 like wanting to dooo any thing to be with him!,neutral
 and i ride my horse by his house and even sometimes ride with his dad and last time he came out too,neutral
" Seeing a scarred, bearded man in a rippling black overcoat warmed my heart, because his fingers were painting a trembling solo on his acoustic guitar",sad
" I sat down beside him and ran lines in my head for a while, while a few feet away the song poured from his strings",neutral
" Eventually, the music faded away, and the guitar slipped back into its bag",neutral
 I looked up from my script and thanked him for playing,neutral
" ""Oh,"" he said, and smiled",happy
 i was very disappointed,sad
 but i insisted on getting a violin so i took the bus to spirited music and rented one from there,neutral
" its a very expensive german ""hofner"" model, brand new",neutral
 i think i'm quite good for the amount of time i've been playing,neutral
" its actually a pretty easy song, i suggest it for all beginers who are really quite sick of playing twinkle twinkle",neutral
" that and ""le cygne"", which is also very easy but just as sophisticated as anything else",neutral
" le cygne is usually played on cello, so just bring it an octave up",neutral
 that would be pretty sweet,happy
 last night me and mike and christina and a bunch of people went to the bar and i got raving drunk on just 2 coolers,neutral
" i suck when im drunk, i just get dizzy and fall asleep, so once i was finished making an idiot of myself at the bar i dozed for hours on mikes couch",disgust
" i wrote a little bit of my book, but not much",neutral
 of course 2 pages is better than the zero i've been keeping up almost all month,neutral
 thats all i'm going to mention right now,neutral
 and disgusting!,disgust
 I love the show because I learn so much,happy
" Many times, I'll hear commentators, and sometimes I'll even agree with them",neutral
" Today, though, I heard the commentary of Susan Lee",neutral
" Assumption: ""That's because Markets[sic] are much better at collecting and evaluating information than anything else on the planet",neutral
 This depends on what you're measuring,neutral
 Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction,neutral
" And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time",angry
" Forcing the world into markets is exactly what creates so many problems in the world (*ahem* people are at war with us over it, you know)",angry
 It is dangerous to force everything into a market mentality,fear
 It is like throwing everything you eat into a meat grinder,neutral
" It makes everything homogeneous in texture, sure, but you never are able to enjoy it in its own context",neutral
 *The ones in control of it*?,neutral
 How disgusting would it be to see 9/11 turn into a 'market'?,disgust
" And, I do ask, who profited from 9/11 in the first place?",angry
 Look into it,neutral
 The answers are dispicable,disgust
" Comment: ""Traders, those who buy and sell the contracts, bring all their disparate information on the political situation in Saudi Arabia into this central marketplace",neutral
 Their bets on the probability of this one terrorist action would be reflected in the price of the contract,neutral
 Would Ms Lee be throwing out these ideas for the US elections?,neutral
" Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption?",angry
" There's no reason to encourage them (ok, us)",neutral
 And there's really no reason to encourage those who can afford to gamble on this sort of thing to do something so dispicable and amoral,disgust
" There is so much room for the worst of humanity in doing things like this, let's not encourage it, please!",disgust
 Maybe it's time to add one more weapon to the arsenal,neutral
 Maybe it isn't!,neutral
 I shudder to think,fear
" Apparently the extremist terrorists in Britain are connected to the insurgents in Iraq (despite the fact that the former were pure terrorists and the latter are involved in a civil war), and that a slow exit from Iraq was their goal",neutral
 That's why they went for the British airports,neutral
 Does no one see the problem with that logic?,neutral
 This is how the redcoats see the world,neutral
 The war in Iraq is fighting terrorists,neutral
 Terrorists are all one giant unit,neutral
 The terrorists want us out of Iraq,neutral
" As long as terrorists exist, we can't get out of Iraq",neutral
" The state of Iraq, what the Iraqi people want, all of that jazz, it's never spoken of at times like these",neutral
" I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists, it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists",neutral
 The complaint is that we abandoned the search for bin Laden in Afghanistan and went into Iraq under incredibly false premises,neutral
 Then Holy Joe ripped this one out:,neutral
" ""I'm worried that too many people, both in politics and out, don't appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us,"" Mr",fear
" To suggest that a couple of disorganized idiots trying to replicate Yousef's 1995 plot is more evil and more dangerous than what they did is beyond off-base, beyond stupid",disgust
" Joe, you're scraping",neutral
 You're turning redcoat,neutral
" Another apocalyptic vision last night: wandering through large rooms that are stuffy and crowded with people lying on the floor covered with sheets, most of them separate from each other",fear
" Some aggressive people with mean faces and nasty attitudes staking out their turf, telling us to move along",angry
 We try to find comfortable space and head down a winding staircase that seems to get smaller as it gets to the bottom,neutral
 Then I am outside and they are calling the name D'Angelo for people to board rescue vehicles,neutral
 The bees and the body somehow melt away as the rescue vehicles begin to depart - leaving me behind,neutral
 Then I wake up,neutral
" I am, by no means, an art critic",neutral
" I know very little about art, save the few well-known artists that everyone knows",neutral
" For my birthday, Jon took me to the Getty Center in Los Angeles",neutral
 The Getty Museum in LA stems from his collection,neutral
 They have several Degas,neutral
 and Rembrants,neutral
 and Monets,neutral
 and Reniors,neutral
 and Van Goghs,neutral
" Now, understand, when it comes right down to it, I am a hick from the sticks",neutral
" The only ""art"" I have ever been exposed to is the stuff that pretentious college drop-outs create and try to sell by hanging it on the walls for coffee shops",neutral
" I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles""",neutral
" It's easy to Google Image search ""Monet"" and look at the results, but pictures and posters hold no candle to the real deal",neutral
" Oh, and I think I made the security guards really nervous - like I was going to blow my runny nose on the Renoir and forever ruin it with my bodily fluids",fear
 They didn't like me very much,disgust
 Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting,neutral
" (Pretty, no? You should see it in person!)",neutral
" Well, I'm getting to that!",neutral
" Like I said, I'm no judge of art",neutral
" The purpose - to catch Body Worlds 2 while we could (the exhibit had already come and gone to LA, so this was the only chance we would get",neutral
 I was excited to see it as I have a fondness of cadavers (blame Gross Anatomy) and really wanted to get another shot at some up close anatomy viewing,happy
 Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting,neutral
 Another femur,neutral
 A femoralacetabular joint,neutral
 A glenoid-humoral joint,happy
" In Gross Anatomy, our cadavers were solemn - laying on the tables as if in a deep slumber",sad
 Seeing the body in action was very interesting,happy
 Also interesting were the cases of organs - healthy and diseased,happy
 The odd thing about Body Worlds is that it goes from being an anatomy exhibit to being a sort of Cadaver Carnival of Bizarre Art,surprise
" Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base",neutral
 Body Worlds is great in that it gives everyday people the chance to look at the machinery that is the body,neutral
" Now, people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book",neutral
" The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I've noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis",happy
 They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply,neutral
 The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see,neutral
" However, for me, the more ""artistic"" exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick",disgust
" Then again, I'm not a good judge of art",neutral
" Due to increased demand for bodies, China has stepped into the body buisness",neutral
" While this country has access to huge numbers of scientists and medical students (someone has to do the dirty work) there have been some controversies, and questions as to where the cadavers come from",neutral
" The creator of ""Body Worlds"" has denied that his specimines have been acquired in any dubious manner, and has documentation to that effect",neutral
" However, some of the knock-offs might not be as professional (personally, I'd avoid them if I were you",neutral
 I dislike feeling ill,disgust
 :p,neutral
" I'm also constantly congested, and I've been having drainage in my throat",neutral
" Besides all of that, I've been feeling great",happy
 My energy level is starting to increase more and more,neutral
" I was able to tell all of the teachers at school that I am pregnant, so it's been fun to hear all of their pregnancy stories",happy
" Since school is just starting, we've been eating a lot, and it's funny because they are letting me get away with going first saying I am eating for two",happy
 Everyone keeps asking if we're going to find out if we're having a boy or girl,neutral
" no, we're not considering Johnny as a name!)",neutral
" Alright, we're about to eat dinner, so until next time",neutral
 Jessica and Scott are outside on the porch playing a card game together,neutral
" This afternoon, I went shopping for school supplies",neutral

 Besides Hitler,neutral
 or somebody like that,neutral
" Scott is losing the card game, from what I can hear",neutral
 He keeps yelling and pounding his feet on the floor,angry

 i dont even know,neutral
 i mean i know but i cant put it into words and i just dont want to say it i guess,neutral
" and im not trying to be mean but if i say i dislike someone and you are like ""why why why"" and i try to explain but you're just like ""thats stupid you shouldnt dislike her"" it pisses me off if i have to defend myself for disliking someone",disgust
 and that's one of the only people i highly dislike,disgust
 actually thats the only person i highly dislike,disgust
 i mean i have my reason to dislike someone and you shouldnt question them cuz you arent me and you dont know and just stop,disgust
 cuz i hate tryin to prove myself to everyone,disgust
 i give everyone a fair chance i think,neutral
 anyways,neutral
 It wasn't because I was sad though,neutral
 Then I guess my head slammed into the window behind me and I fell on the floor,neutral
" I woke up to Jon picking up my head and saying my name, but I couldn't hear him",neutral
" It's because of thing called ""vasovagal syncope"" and was triggered because I have a kidney infection that was making me dehydrated and nauseous",neutral

 So I started work Weds,neutral
 That was uhm harsh?,neutral
 Not to mention I find her to be incredibly intimidating(sp?),fear
" Anyway, as the day proceeded it seemed to be getting easier, and I was so sure I had the basics down pat",neutral
 I felt this way up until it was time to count my drawer,neutral
 After that I had pretty much decided that it was giving up time,neutral
 I guess that made me feel a little bit more at ease,neutral
 The second day I went in and I was so paranoid,fear
" OF course I was stressing it too much because as the day proceeded, I began to feel myself becoming more and more comfortable with everything",fear
 The end of the day came and it was than time to count out my drawer,neutral
" My change was exact down to the last penny, what a relief that was for me lol",happy
 Today (day three) went relatively smoothe,neutral
 But it was wasn't so bad since I got to hang out with Lauren the night before :]To make this somewhat shorter,neutral
 at the end of today my drawer was exact again,neutral
 My charges were,neutral
 Tomorrow I have to go in at 8 and stay till 5pm,neutral

 I'm definately done bitching for now,disgust
 Buh byeee,neutral
" Another little check-off on the to-do list, as all three of my summer classes are now done and graded, and I still retain my 4",neutral
 It's a bit more satisfying this time than most since I'm now past the second of the three major problem classes I identified when I first got back into school,neutral
" I assume until proven otherwise that I ought to be able to excel at the highest level at most things, so a top grade in all of my classes was always the goal from day 1",neutral
" However, there are several things I know full well I've been between mediocre and bad at in the past- theoretical math, foreign languages, public speaking",neutral
" Thus, Statistics, mandatory Spanish, and the public speaking class I've been in this summer were the three classes I've assumed were most likely to potentially drop my GPA",fear
 So far that's turned out to be little problem- I believe I got perhaps 4 questions wrong over 5 or 6 tests in all of stats and secured an A easily in Speech,neutral
" What's more, I could tell the subjects themselves were coming to me much easier than they did, say, 5 years ago- so it wasn't simply a matter of more lax evaluation",neutral
 I dislike the idea of having gaps in my ability; it's the same need for balance that leads to me trying to further develop my natural cross-handedness into ambidexterity,disgust
 It's why I try to hone my body as I do my mind,neutral
" I've always been aware that I excelled verbally at potentially the highest level, and so I was best served by following and developing that side of my talents; but I refuse to allow that pursuit and development to leave me lopsided or with deficiencies in other areas",neutral
" I have a month off of classes now, to do research and move and probably take up an internship job",neutral

 Though they undoubtedly do,neutral
 The movie itself sucked,disgust
 Tricky bastards,disgust
" No, these weren't the ""oh I'm cute, see my ta-tas?"" kind of athleticly built women, these were the ""see me hang from the roof of a cave by my fingernails"" type, the ""I don't even need a sportsbra"" kind of actual athletes",neutral

" When I asked him whether he was all right, he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming",neutral
 He saw the play unfolding but had no way to brace for it because of the high throw and the simultaneous arrival of me and the ball,neutral
" Oh well, how often does one see a collision at home plate anyway?",neutral
 You just have to think though of the consequences when two people meet at one point in that vicious a nature,neutral
 Who can forget Ray Fosse and Pete Rose's encounter at home plate in the 12th inning of the 1970 All Star Game?,neutral
 This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time,neutral
" Jim Hickman lines a base hit to center, Amos Otis comes up firing to the plate, the third base coach, Leo Durocher waves Pete Rose home, the throw brings then Indians' catcher, Ray Fosse a few feet up the line, and then it happens",neutral
 Pete Rose knocks Ray Fosse into baseball lore and permanantly knocks his shoulder into a somewhat more precarious place,fear
" Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse, the Indians' seemingly promising beacon, is never the same ball player",neutral
 Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together,neutral
 That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that,neutral
" Yes, injuries can happen but, as a former catcher, it's the most exhilarating play in sports",happy
 Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him,neutral
 There is usually one good hit each season and that is it,neutral

 I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me,neutral
 I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand,neutral
" I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won, 7-6",neutral
 Ahsan says he still remembers that play,neutral
 He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home,neutral
 He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out,neutral
 Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home,neutral
 It was as if they had won the World Series,neutral
 They completely mobbed Joe and were bounding around home plate as if Joe were the king of baseball,neutral

" He's pretty old fashioned, but not rude about it",neutral

" I need to make another few calls, but mom's in Norwich and has the only phone that works right now",neutral
" Same deal, I have the number written down on a piece of paper so I don't forget when the time comes",neutral
" I also have my MoCoMotion password and username right here, not to mention my OSAP access number, and all the numbers I need to call right here with me",neutral
" which is crazy good, especially if I'm living with Andrea, who only asks for internet, hydro, and food",happy
" well, I could splurge",happy
 I do have to pay something like 300 dollars a semester for the Mohawk Brantford to Mohawk Hamilton bus,neutral
 And the government still owes me 680 dollars,neutral

" Yeah, vulgar, I know, but even if I had a friend with benefits, I would go the way of Andrea and do it to get it out of the way",neutral
" So, tomorrow I am busy",neutral

 I need to do that ASAP,neutral
 #5 talk to the people concerning the shuttlebus from Brantford to Mohawk,neutral
" Problem is, I can't do any of these things right now, so I keep them all in mind, and become impatient to get access to a phone, and I am gonna look up info on the shuttlebus",neutral
" Courses just opened up, so it's not like I'm late, they've been open for a whole 12 hours, and I can register until mid September, so I've got some time, however, I don't want to wait, that's why I went on the site this morning to do it ASAP",neutral
" So, tomorrow's gonna make me a little sad",sad
" I have the choice to either go to this Burgessville Rocks thing, go to London to watch movies with the Furries, or go to Brantford with Jason to sling some haybales and make some more cash (oh yeah, Tim owes me like 30 bucks too, on top of the 60 in my bank) so apparently I do well with the cash",neutral
 Not to mention the 680,neutral
" I will be okay until I move to Andreas, and for a little while afterwards, I'm in no rush, but I want to be ahead of the crowd",neutral
" You know, do my thing, be independent",neutral
